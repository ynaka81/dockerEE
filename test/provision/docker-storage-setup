# The volume group to use for docker storage.  Defaults to the
# volume group where the root filesystem resides.  If VG is specified and the

# ROOT_SIZE=8G

# The desired size for the docker data LV.  It defaults using 60% of all
# free space.
#
# DATA_SIZE can take values acceptable to "lvcreate -L" as well as some
# values acceptable to to "lvcreate -l". If user intends to pass values
# acceptable to "lvcreate -l", then only those values which contains "%"

# value is suitable for "lvcreate -L".
